#' Aggregated investment cost data for REMIND regions (based on IEA_WEO)
#' @description Disaggregated investment cost data is aggregated and technologies renamed to REMIND names
#' @details REMIND does not have a classification of coal power plants e.g., sub-critical.
#' Therefore, countries are given coal plant costs assuming what type of coal plants are
#' expected to develop there. For other technologies, certain assumptions are taken
#' to change to REMIND convention.
#' @return Magpie object with aggregated but differentiated investment costs for some technologies.
