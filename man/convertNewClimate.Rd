\title{Convert policy targets for NPIs from New Climate policy database}
\usage{
convertNewClimate(x, subtype, subset)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a magclass object to be converted}

\item{subtype}{Capacity_YYYY_cond or Capacity_YYYY_uncond for Capacity Targets, Emissions_YYYY_cond or
Emissions_YYYY_uncond for Emissions targets, with YYYY NPI version year}

\item{subset}{String, designating the GDP scenarios to use. Only used for emission targets.}
}
\description{
Converts conditional and unconditional capacity and production targets into total capacity (GW) in target year.
For countries and years without targets, 2015 values from IRENA and BP are used to fill the gaps.
}
\details{
Emission targets are represented by a GHG factor, which is the quotient of total GHG
emissions in the target year divided by the CEDS GHG emissions in 2005.
